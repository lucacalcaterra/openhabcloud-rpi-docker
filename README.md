# openhabcloud-rpi-docker

This is an arrangement of docker-compose (ARM images) for running openhab cloud instance on your ARM device (Raspberry, TinkerBoard,etc.) 

Currently tested on my instance , with Raspberry and Asus Tinkerboard

It's not so wide tested, so...Feel to open new issues and ask if you have troubles.
